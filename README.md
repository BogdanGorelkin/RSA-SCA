# RSA-SCA
This project related to my master thesis. 
Here I implemented the experiment to obtain temperature data from the side chanel attacks on RSA crypthoalgorithm.
This data and experimental PhD student will use in his further work.
Experiment was done on the STM32f070Rb microcontroller.
The project was implemented in cooperation of two universities ([TUSUR](https://tusur.ru/en) and [Politech of Nantes](https://polytech.univ-nantes.fr/)) in the [IETR](https://www.ietr.fr/) laboratory
