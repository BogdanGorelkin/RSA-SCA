# RSA-SCA
This project related to my master thesis. 
Here I implemented the experiment to obtain the data of temperature (side chanel attacks) on the RSA crypthoalgorithm during decripting.
This data and experimental PhD student will use in his further work.
Experiment was done on the STM32f070Rb microcontroller.
This project was done under double degree program between two cooperating university ([TUSUR](https://tusur.ru/en) and [Polytech of Nantes](https://polytech.univ-nantes.fr/)) at the lab (IETR)[https://www.ietr.fr/]
