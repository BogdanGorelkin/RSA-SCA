# RSA-SCA
This project related to my master thesis. 
Here I implemented the experiment to obtain the data of temperature (side chanel attacks) on the RSA crypthoalgorithm.
This data and experimental PhD student will use in his further work.
Experiment was done on the STM32f070Rb microcontroller.
The project was implemented in cooperation of two universities ([TUSUR](https://tusur.ru/en) and [Politech of Nantes](https://polytech.univ-nantes.fr/)) in the [IETR](https://www.ietr.fr/) laboratory
